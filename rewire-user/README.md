# rewire-user

This package is meant to provide a "standard library" for ReWire programs as
well as enable typechecking and compiling ReWire programs with `ghc`. Haskell
modules in this package should be compatible with both `rwc` and `ghc`.

If we add tests to this package, they should test for compatibility with `ghc`.
`rwc` tests should go in the parent rewire package.
